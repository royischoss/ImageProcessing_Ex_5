I had two tryouts before succes. the first was taking small patch 8x8 and trying to do a lot of epoch steps.
the thinking behind it was maybe I am loosing the minimum point in the gradient decent and try to solve smaller
 problems. It didn't go as I have planed.
The second try was to enlarge the number of pictures in the batch so we get more patches to learn from.
it was also a fail my guess was that the amount of picture doesn't help because the patches are very different 
from each other.  The lest try was to enlarge the number of channels for more information about the same 
picture and stil taking a big amount of epoch steps so we won't go over the minimum point of the gradient. 
The parameter I have chosen are : 
patch size - 24x24, 
number of channels = 60, 
batch_size = 100, 
epoch_steps = 500, 
epochs = 7.
