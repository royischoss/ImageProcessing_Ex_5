I had two tryouts before succes. the first was taking small patch 8x8 and trying to do alot of epoch steps. the thinking behind it was maybe I am loosing details let try solve smaller problems. It didn't go as I have plained.The second try was to enlarge the number of pictures in the batch so we get more patches to learn from. it was also a fail.  The lest try was to enlarge the number of channels for more information about the same picture and stil taking a big amount of epoch steps so we won't go over the minimum point of the gradient. The parameter I have chosen are : patch size - 24x24, number of channels = 60, batch_size = 100, epoch_steps = 500, epochs = 7.
