The implemantation of the SR task I have chosen is corrupting using the scipy zoom function. using zoom first I 
downsized the image by a factor between 2-4 , and the second use is enlarging it with the same factor. 
this caused loosing resulution in grayscale between the original image pixels and the coruupted one. 
wich was our plan.
In the function learn_super_resolution_model I implemented in a similar way as the previous training using 
diffrent parameters as I describe in Q_2.
