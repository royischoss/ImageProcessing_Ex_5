As the graphs shows both denoising and deblurring lost value was effected by the depth of the network.
we got a faster  convergence to the minimum and stayed low in the validation for bigger depth.
while for the depth of one or two block we saw a bigger lost value.
It's shown on the photos too as we saw the small amount of blocks gave us bit more blury and noisie photo.
This facts goes with the fact that the deeper network we get the better we can describe a complex function and 
this way we can get closer to the function who describes the way to reconstruct the image.
