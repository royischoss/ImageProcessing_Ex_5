As the graphs shows both denoising and deblurring lost value was effected by the depth of the network.
we got a faster  convergence to the minimum and stayed lowe in the validation. while for the depth of one or two
block we saw big lost value.
it's shown on the photos too as we saw the small amount of blocks gave us bit more blury and noisie photo.
