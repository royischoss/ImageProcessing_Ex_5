As the graphs shows both denoising and deblurring lost value was effected by the depth of the network.
we got a faster  convergence to the minimum and stayed low in the validation for bigger depth.
while for the depth of one or two block we saw a bigger lost value.
it's shown on the photos too as we saw the small amount of blocks gave us bit more blury and noisie photo.
